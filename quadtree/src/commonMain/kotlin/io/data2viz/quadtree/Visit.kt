/**
 * Visits each node in the quadtree in pre-order traversal, invoking the specified callback with arguments
 * node, x0, y0, x1, y1 for each node, where node is the node being visited, ⟨x0, y0⟩ are the lower bounds of the
 * node, and ⟨x1, y1⟩ are the upper bounds.
 * (Assuming that positive x is right and positive y is down, as is typically the case in Canvas and SVG,
 * ⟨x0, y0⟩ is the top-left corner and ⟨x1, y1⟩ is the lower-right corner; however, the coordinate system is arbitrary,
 * so more formally x0 <= x1 and y0 <= y1).
 *
 * If the callback returns true for a given node, then the children of that node are not visited; otherwise,
 * all child nodes are visited. This can be used to quickly visit only parts of the tree, for example when
 * using the Barnes–Hut approximation.
 * Note, however, that child quadrants are always visited in sibling order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
 * bottom-right. In cases such as search, visiting siblings in a specific order may be faster.
