/**
 * Constructs a new custom interval given the specified floor and offset functions and an optional count function.
 *
 * The floor function takes a single date as an argument and rounds it down to the nearest interval boundary.
 *
 * The offset function takes a date and an integer step as arguments and advances the specified date by
 * the specified number of boundaries; the step may be positive, negative or zero.
 *
 * The optional count function takes a start date and an end date, already floored to the current interval, and
 * returns the number of boundaries between the start (exclusive) and end (inclusive).
 * If a count function is not specified, the returned interval does not allow interval.count or interval.every methods.
 * Note: due to an internal optimization, the specified count function must not invoke interval.count on other time intervals.
 *
 * The optional field function takes a date, already floored to the current interval, and returns the field value
 * of the specified date, corresponding to the number of boundaries between this date (exclusive) and the latest
 * previous parent boundary.
 * For example, for the timeDay interval, this returns the number of days since the start of the month.
 * If a field function is not specified, it defaults to counting the number of interval boundaries since the UNIX
 * epoch of January 1, 1970 UTC. The field function defines the behavior of interval.every.
 *
 * [floor] Returns a new date representing the latest interval boundary date before or equal to date.
 * For example, d2v.timeDay.floor(date) typically returns 12:00 AM local time on the given date.
 * This method is idempotent: if the specified date is already floored to the current interval, a new date
 * with an identical time is returned.
 * Furthermore, the returned date is the minimum expressible value of the associated interval,
 * such that interval.floor(interval.floor(date) - 1) returns the preceeding interval boundary date.
 *
 * [offset] Returns a new date equal to date plus step intervals.
 * If step is not specified it defaults to 1.
 * If step is negative, then the returned date will be before the specified date;
 * if step is zero, then a copy of the specified date is returned.
 * This method does not round the specified date to the interval.
 * For example, if date is today at 5:34 PM, then d2v.timeDay.offset(date, 1) returns 5:34 PM tomorrow
 * (even if daylight saving changes!).
